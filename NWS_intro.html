<P>&quot;Erm, excuse me?&quot;</P>

<P>A young woman stood in the doorway of the Old Angel, otherworldly
in her beauty. Her voice was silk sliding over skin, her eyes were bluer
than summer sky and her hair shone brighter than the sun</P>

<P>Juan, who had been enjoying a quiet pint with his friend Arthur, leapt to
his feet. &quot;How can we be of service to you, O sublime vision of
loveliness? Perhaps a small glass of wine?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh... &quot; The woman blushed. &quot;I don't usually drink wine, it makes me
so silly.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Nonsense,&quot; said Juan, signalling the barman.</P>

<P>Arthur and Juan watched the woman intently as she lifted the glass to her
mouth and took the tiniest mouthful, then giggled.</P>

<P>&quot;That'll show Porta! He says I can't be trusted to drink anything stronger
than nectar!&quot;</P>

<P>Juan leaned towards her. &quot;Tell me, who is this Porta? I shall challenge him
to a duel in defence of your honour.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh! You mustn't do that!&quot; she replied. &quot;When I am Queen he will be King
by my side.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;A Princess? How enchanting! Allow me to introduce myself.I am Don Juan, and this lout is Arthur Seaton. May we know your name?&quot;</P>

<P>The Princess giggled again. &quot;Delighted, I'm sure. I'm Finestra. I'm here on
my honeymoon. From Fairy-land, you know.&quot; And she suddenly burst into
tears.</P>

<P>&quot;Now see what you've done, Juan,&quot; said Arthur.</P>

<P>&quot;Oh,&quot; she sobbed, &quot;don't worry. I'll be fine once I've found Porta. But
he said he deserved better than a tiny room at the Ibis, and we had a fight,
he just went out on his own. I followed him but I got lost.&quot;</P>

<P>Arthur said, &quot;It's just one of those things, ain't it? This Porta'll be back
soon enough.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I need to find him though,&quot; said Finestra. She drank the rest of her wine
and started to stand up. &quot;Perhaps I should go - &quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No, no,&quot; said the two men, simultaneously. Arthur continued, &quot;It'd do you
good to spend a bit of time on yer own. Leave that man of yours to stew.
And we'd look after you, wouldn't we, Juan?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Of course we would,&quot; replied Juan. &quot;I think that calls for another drink.&quot;</P>
