<P>&quot;Erm, excuse me?&quot;</P>

<P>A young woman stood in the doorway of the Old Angel, otherworldly
in her beauty. Her voice was silk sliding over skin, her eyes were bluer
than summer sky and her hair shone brighter than the sun</P>

<P>Juan, who had been enjoying a quiet pint with his friend Arthur, leapt to
his feet. &quot;How can we be of service to you, O sublime vision of
loveliness? Perhaps a small glass of wine?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh... &quot; The woman blushed. &quot;I don't usually drink wine, it makes me
so silly.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Nonsense,&quot; said Juan, signalling the barman.</P>

<P>Arthur and Juan watched the woman intently as she lifted the glass to her
mouth and took the tiniest mouthful, then giggled.</P>

<P>&quot;That'll show Porta! He says I can't be trusted to drink anything stronger
than nectar!&quot;</P>

<P>Juan leaned towards her. &quot;Tell me, who is this Porta? I shall challenge him
to a duel in defence of your honour.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh! You mustn't do that!&quot; she replied. &quot;When I am Queen he will be King
by my side.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;A Princess? How enchanting! Allow me to introduce myself.I am Don Juan, and this lout is Arthur Seaton. May we know your name?&quot;</P>

<P>The Princess giggled again. &quot;Delighted, I'm sure. I'm Finestra. I'm here on
my honeymoon. From Fairy-land, you know.&quot; And she suddenly burst into
tears.</P>

<P>&quot;Now see what you've done, Juan,&quot; said Arthur.</P>

<P>&quot;Oh,&quot; she sobbed, &quot;don't worry. I'll be fine once I've found Porta. But
he said he deserved better than a tiny room at the Ibis, and we had a fight,
he just went out on his own. I followed him but I got lost.&quot;</P>

<P>Arthur said, &quot;It's just one of those things, ain't it? This Porta'll be back
soon enough.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I need to find him though,&quot; said Finestra. She drank the rest of her wine
and started to stand up. &quot;Perhaps I should go - &quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No, no,&quot; said the two men, simultaneously. Arthur continued, &quot;It'd do you
good to spend a bit of time on yer own. Leave that man of yours to stew.
And we'd look after you, wouldn't we, Juan?&quot;</P>

<div id="outro" class="textwrapper">

<P>Arthur, Juan and Finestra were each staring at an empty glass.</P>

<P>&quot;I’m afraid Porta went off with my money,&quot; said Finestra.</P>

<P>&quot;Let’s find the loser and give ’im a talking to!&quot; Arthur struggled to his feet. &quot;He can buy the next round!&quot;</P>

<P>Finestra pulled out a baby-pink mobile phone, stabbed at it, then her face fell. &quot;Oh no!&quot; she cried. &quot;He texted me ages ago, saying he was very sorry. He says he’s outside The Bell.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;We’d better go there then.&quot; said Arthur, leading the way out onto Stoney Street.</P>

<P>As they rounded the corner of the Council House Finestra shrieked with delight. &quot;Look! Fountains!&quot;</P>

<P>She ran across the Square and started to dance with the streams of water, and they danced with her. Some of the braver (or possibly drunker) revellers joined in, and before long there was a huge crowd dancing in and out of each other’s paths, following the twisting and twirling water.</P>

<P>Arthur caught a neon-yellow movement in the corner of his eye, and nudged Juan. </P>

<P>&quot;Look ’ere, the coppers are sticking their noses in. We’d better get Finestra out of there.&quot;</P>

<P>Before they could move, a tall, perfectly-formed man sliced through the onlookers, swept Finestra up in his arms, and swooped back through the gap he had left in the crowd.</P>

<P>Juan shouted, &quot;Hey, you!&quot; and Arthur yelled, &quot;You ain’t kidnapping our Princess!&quot; and they set off in pursuit, leaving chaos behind them as the fountains returned to their usual courses and the police moved in to break up the mob.</P>

<P>They didn’t have far to go. The handsome stranger stopped outside The Bell, and carefully seated Finestra at an empty table.</P>

<P>Finestra looked up at them, her eyes sparkling. &quot;My dearest Juan and Arthur, I should very much like you to meet Prince Porta.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Charmed, I’m sure,&quot; said Porta, absently.</P>

<P>Finestra gazed adoringly into his eyes, and he gazed into hers.</P>

<P>Arthur sighed and turned to Juan. &quot;Don’t suppose we’ll be getting drinks out of these two tonight.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Never mind, I saw Resnick going into Yates’s. He’s usually good for a pint or two.&quot;
Finestra didn’t even notice them leave.</P>
