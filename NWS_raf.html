<P>&quot;I shall purchase another round,&quot; announced Juan.</P>

<P>Finestra was looking prettily dishevelled by now. &quot;It would be jolly to try some beer.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;As you wish,&quot; said Juan.</P>

<P>&quot;A pint o’ good ale’ll see you right, petal,&quot; said Arthur.</P>

<P>&quot;Give you a new angle on that fool of a husband. Men, y’see, aren’t as sensible as women. We kick off about stuff, on impulse or whatever, then we go out and down a few pints and forget all about it. We don’t mean no harm by it.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Perhaps that is so,&quot; replied Finestra. &quot;But, you see, my Godmother is so generous. It’s most unfair of him to talk badly about her.&quot;</P>

<P>Arthur said, &quot;What I mean is, you two’ve got a job for life, he’s a good bloke who loves you even if he’s a bit of an idiot sometimes, and you’ve got a castle or summat to live in, wi’ no mortgage or rent to worry about. So things could be a whole lot worse, see?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Maybe, but he went off having adventures and left me waiting around, and even when I had my own adventures here in Nottingham he kept interfering. I don’t want to just be Porta’s wife. I want to do things on my own account.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yer one of them feminists, ain’t you? Not happy unless you’ve got some poor bloke at yer beck and… Aargh!&quot;</P>

<P>Juan had poured a careful measure of beer down Arthur’s neck.</P>

<P>&quot;I don’t care how you speak to your Doreen, Arthur, but that is not the way one addresses a Princess.&quot;</P>

<P>Arthur had the grace to look abashed. &quot;Sorry, Finestra,&quot; he muttered.</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, that’s quite all right,&quot; said Finestra, slurring her words slightly. 

<P>&quot;And please don’t quarrel on my account. You’re both such lovely men.&quot;</P>
