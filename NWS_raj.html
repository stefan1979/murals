<P>&quot;Erm…&quot; said Finestra, &quot;I, erm…&quot; </p>

<P>&quot;You, erm, what?&quot; said Arthur.</p>

<P>&quot;I… need to… you know…&quot;</p>

<P>&quot;You need to what?&quot;</p>

<P>&quot;Well…&quot; Finestra looked pleadingly at Juan. &quot;You know…?&quot;</p>

<P>&quot;Of course,&quot; said Don Juan. &quot;You need to powder your pretty nose. Just through that door.&quot;</p>

<P>Finestra took her pretty self off to the lavatory without a backward glance at the men. They gazed after her adoringly.</p>

<P>&quot;That’s a facer, ain’t it?&quot; said Arthur.</p>

<P>&quot;If you say so. I’m not sure what you mean,&quot; replied Juan.</p>

<P>&quot;This fancy piece comes over all ‘I’m a Fairy Princess’ and we’re supposed to believe her? What’s her game?&quot;</p>

<P>&quot;Honestly,&quot; said Juan, &quot;we’re two fictional characters drinking fine beer in a Nottingham pub, why is it impossible that the Prince and Princess of Fairy-land would honeymoon here? You need to open your mind, sir.&quot;</p>

<P>"Yeah, whatever.&quot;</p>

<P>&quot;It’s perfectly clear that I should be the one to look after her, anyway. I have more experience with women from far-off lands.&quot; Juan’s eyes misted over. &quot;She reminds me of my fair Haidée.&quot;</p>

<P>&quot;Why should you be the one to look after her?&quot;</p>

<P>&quot;Your sensibilities are rather crude. Far too uncouth for such a lovely young lady.&quot;</p>

<P>Arthur leaped to his feet, fists at the ready. &quot;I’ll give yer crude sensibilities. What do you know about women? And what do yer know about Nottingham, come to that? Arthur Seaton knows how to give a girl a good time, just you ask my Doreen. Can’t ask your Haidée about you though, can we? She’s dead…&quot;</p>

<P>Juan was also on his feet by this time, and if the barman hadn’t whistled to catch the men’s attention, he would have laid Arthur out with a righteously placed uppercut.</p>

<P>Both men were sitting down and smiling through clenched teeth by the time Finestra returned.</p>
