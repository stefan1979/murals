<P>&quot;I believe, Arthur, it is your turn to buy the drinks,&quot; said Juan. &quot;Why don’t you get the lovely Finestra a G&amp;T?&quot;</P>

<P>Grumbling, Arthur set off for the bar.</P>

<P>&quot;So, fair Princess, how may we entertain you? I could tell you stories of my adventures. You would soon forget your wayward Prince.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Why, Don Juan, if I were to forget Porta, it would be for one as dashing as yourself. I’d love to hear your stories.&quot;</P>

<P>Juan beamed with pleasure. &quot;I grew up in Seville, in a grand house. I received the attention of many tutors, therefore I am most accomplished in music, swordplay, languages, mathematics and literature. Unfortunately, when I was but sixteen, I also received the attention of Donna Julia. When her husband discovered us—&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Discovered you doing what, pray?&quot;</P>

<P>Juan blushed deep scarlet. &quot;That is not for your pretty ears. Suffice to say, I had to leave Seville. I set sail for Italy, and my misfortune continued. The ship capsized, and I was the only survivor. I found my way to shore, starving and near death, on an Aegean island, where the beautiful Haidée nursed me back to health...&quot; </P>

<P>Juan’s attention drifted, and he fell silent.</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, Juan, was Haidée the love of your life?&quot;</P>

<P>Juan nodded. &quot;She was the most kind, the most beautiful…&quot; </P>

<P>He drifted again, then shook himself. &quot;Finestra, if Porta is your one true love, you must not let him go. You must chase after him. Take it from one who has loved and lost too many times.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;But I don’t know if I can forgive him. He said some awful things about my dear kind Godmother.&quot;</P>

<P>Arthur returned to the table carrying two pints and a gin and tonic. </P>

<P>&quot;What’s ’appened here? You both look like someone’s strangled yer pet puppies. Get these drinks down yer necks.&quot;</P>
