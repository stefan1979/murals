<P>&quot;Oi, posh boy, I’ve run out of ale again,&quot; said Arthur.</P>

<P>&quot;Another G&amp;T, Princess?&quot;</P>

<P>Finestra nodded vigorously. &quot;You really must tell me what divine ingredients make up this G&amp;T. I’d so like to make it for dear Mummy and Daddy. They’re the King and Queen, you know—&quot;</P>

<P>Arthur glowered. &quot;Yes, I bloody do know. You keep banging on about it like you’re something special, don’t yer. Just because you’re a flippin’ Princess?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Do you think you’re less special than me? Because I certainly don’t think so. You make bicycles—they are such fun to ride.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That were the owd days, before the factory closed. Now I’m signing on. Read a lot o’ books. I’m like owd Sillitoe – started off a working man, ended up a thinker. I never joined the Air Force though.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I’ve always wanted to fly. It’s not true that fairies can fly—I so wish it was!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Didn’t do Alan much good. Got tuberculosis, spent months in ’ospital. That’s where ’e got the writing bug. I was in his first book, then he wrote the film script. Bloody Albert Finney, got it all wrong. I’m nothing like that…&quot; </P>

<P>Finestra was looking confused. &quot;Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, you know?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I’m so sorry, I’m not sure I do. But please carry on, it’s so interesting.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;’E wrote plays and more books and poems and stuff. Drew maps as well—even one which ’e said were really a poem.&quot;</P>

<P>Juan put three drinks down. &quot;My dear Finestra, you must excuse Arthur. He can be such a bore sometimes.&quot;</P>

<P>The Princess’s head, which was nodding slightly, jerked up and her cornflower-blue eyes opened wide. &quot;No no, all very interesting. Very intereshting.&quot; She seized the G&amp;T and emptied it in one draught.</P>

<P>&quot;See?&quot; said Arthur. &quot;Nothing snobby about this one, Juan. Told you she were all right, didn’t I?&quot;</P>
