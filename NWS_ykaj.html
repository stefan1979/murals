<P>Finestra stood up. &quot;I need to… erm… again. Would you please excuse me?&quot;</P>

<P>Finestra wove her way across the bar towards the toilets.</P>

<P>&quot;Such a lovely creature,&quot; sighed Juan.</P>

<P>&quot;Mebbe, but she’s not in our world, is she? Daft ideas about happy-ever-after, and marriage a bed of roses wi’ no thorns.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;But she isn’t of our world, though she’s in it at the moment,&quot; said Juan.</P>

<P>&quot;I blame her author.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You may have a point. After all, she was best-known for The Rose Fyleman Fairy Book.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Bloody fairies. Not down-to-earth, like my author. Alan Sillitoe knew what ’e was writing about. Worked up at Raleigh, just like me.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Sillitoe did well for a working-class lad, but he just wrote what he knew. Lord Byron was on the side of the workers despite his privilege.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;If yer say so. Still lived in Newstead Abbey and was in the House of Lords though, wasn’t ’e? Never worked a day in ’is life, if yer ask me.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;These men were willing to dig, but the spade was in other hands; they were not ashamed to beg, but there was none to relieve them. Their own means of subsistence were cut off; all other employments pre-occupied; and their excesses, however to be deplored and condemned, can hardly be the subject of surprise.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Byron’s maiden speech in the House of Lords. Standing up for the framebreakers. And he fought in the Greek War of Independence, to free common people from the tyrannical Ottoman Empire. He wasn’t out of touch with working people.&quot;</P>

<P>Arthur had the grace to look ashamed, but he still mumbled, &quot;Yeah, but ’e were still a nob, weren’t ’e?&quot;</P>

<P>Again, Finestra returned to find the men smiling through gritted teeth. She slumped into her chair, and said, &quot;I don’ think your beer agrees with me…&quot;</P>
