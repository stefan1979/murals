<P>&quot;Juan,&quot; whispered Arthur, &quot;Lend us a tenner?&quot;</P>

<P>Juan sighed, and passed Arthur a crumpled ten-pound note. Arthur tramped off to the bar.</P>

<P>Juan turned to Finestra. &quot;Salt of the earth, and all that, but sometimes I wish I had more refined company.&quot; He grinned and winked.</P>

<P>His grin faded somewhat as Finestra frowned.</P>

<P>&quot;What?&quot; said Juan. &quot;Don’t tell me you like mingling with commoners?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;How can you be so horrid and snobbish? Some of my best friends over the years have been ordinary people! Why, even my author was quite ordinary!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Ordinary? Her father was in the lace trade and her mother a Russian princess!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Rose’s mother was Russian, but not a princess. Her father was only a merchant. Rose had to fight for everything she wanted, same as Sillitoe. She wanted to be a teacher, but she failed her exams. So she worked hard and became a singer, and taught singing instead.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Travelling Europe and teaching the children of royal families, I’m sure.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;No, she worked at her sister’s school in Nottingham teaching children you’d call ‘common’. And she worked as a translator (she knew French and German and Italian, you know), and wrote lots of poems and books. I met her the first time I came to Nottingham. She wrote about our adventures together.&quot;</P>

<P>Don Juan snorted, &quot;I’ve read A Princess Comes to Our Town. She wasn’t working class. She had a housekeeper!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Of course she did!&quot; Finestra’s eyes were flashing.</P>

<P>&quot;She worked so hard she couldn’t look after the house herself. While I was staying with her she only made time to spend with me by working half the night. I won’t have you thinking badly of her, I won’t!&quot;</P>

<P>Juan knew when to back off. He apologised profusely, and accepted his fresh pint from Arthur with a sense of relief.</P>
